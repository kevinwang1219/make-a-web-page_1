      <h5>Communicating with the Computer</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="communicating.descript">
      <p>
        The World Wide Web is a form of communications for computers. It allows our own home computer contact other computers on the web. For example,
        <a href="www.google.com"> <b>this link</b> </a>, if you were to click it, tells other computers that you want to access google. Therefore, by clicking it, you tell a server, and the server responds by opening the google webpage for you.

      <h5>Computers Are Not the Smartest.</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="stupid.descript">
      <p>
        What we mean when we say computers are not the smartest is that they take everything we type literally. You can say that computers lack common sense; therefore, it is what coding so fustrating but fun at the same time. The smallest errors can have the
        biggest impact.

      <h5>Inline vs Block</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="inlinedescript">
      <p>
        HTML code is either inline or block. Block elements create a small box around the content that is inside of it.

    <h2>Stage 1:  Work Session 1</h2>
    <div class="stage1work1descript">
      <p>
        In stage 1 we looked further into HTML,CSS and DOM, as well started learning the structuring of a website. We should look at the structure of a website in boxes. It is easier to break down if we look at the page into separate sections, or rectangles.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="html">
      <h5>HTML</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="htmldescript">
      <p>
        HTML is the language of page, which dictates the syntax and rules. It is the standard markup language used to create webpages. It consists of tags, which are "elements" in the tree.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="css">
      <h5>CSS</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="cssdescript">
      <p>
        Also known as Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to style the webpage. It dictates the way the page will look.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="dom">
      <h5>DOM</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="domdescript">
      <p>
        Also known as Document Object Model. It is known for the tree like structure of the code. It helps reading code more organized and easier to read.
      </p>
      <p>
        The structure, or DOM, of a webpage is built like a tree.  Not literally a tree, but there are branches within branches to help organize the page. HTML elements have open tags, as well as closed tags. Each tag can consist of more elements or text.  The structure of the page helps identify how the page is classified, in which it tells the browser what is an image, text, and etc. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of it like a family: you and your siblings are branches of your parents.  Your parents are branches of your grandparents.  If you are/were to have kids, they are going to be branches of you. Code is very similar in that aspect.

    <div class="repeat">
      <h5>Avoid Repeating Yourself</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="repeatdescript">
      <p>
        Programmers hate having to repeat themselves. Not only does it make it inefficient, but it would be very time consuming when needing to go back to fix the code. It also helps others make the code more readable. If you're consistent in your code, people
        who want to fix it can do so accordingly and efficiently.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also a good way to avoid errors. By having your code more readable, you're able to see where you made the mistakes. For Example: forgot the closing tag, the indent isn't where it is suppose to be, etc.
      </p>

    <div class="furthercss">
      <h5>Further Look into CSS</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="furthercssdescript">
      <p>
        In work session 2, we start to look deeper into the structure of code, as well as css. We start to learn how to code using css and emphasize the importance of adding classes into our code. This helps us separate HTML and CSS so code is easier to read.
